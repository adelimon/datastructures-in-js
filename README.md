Data structures in Javascript

Keeping a reference of various data structures as they are written in Javascript as I go through a refersher on this stuff.  Last time I did this material was 20 years ago and I did it in Java.  I chose Javascript for this since the language is second nature rather than learning Python and doing this.

Notes are based on material from
